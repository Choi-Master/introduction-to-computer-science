## About this curriculum

Welcome to the Intro to Computer Science Curriculum. This curriculum is intended for teaching Introduction to Computer Science.

## Associated Readings

We have included with this curriculum Associated Readings to dive deeper into topics specific to the instruction of this course. These readings have been adapted from "Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" by. Allen B. Downey. ([HTML Version](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html))([PDF Version](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf)).They are specifically referenced in the lesson plans and the [full document](readings.md) is included.


## Python Versions (2 vs 3)

Python is an evolving language. Python 3 is a major upgrade to the language, released in 2010. There is a lot of existing software written under Python 2, and there is resistance to upgrading to Python 3 due to code breakage and cost. Just as a car part from a 10-year-old model car will probably not fit a new model of the same car, Python 2 code probably would not run in a Python 3 environment. In Python 3 there are new features, significant upgrades "underneath" which makes the code run better and/or faster as well as no longer supporting (deprecating) some Python 2 capabilities. When looking at Python code, be careful to note whether it is Python 2 or Python 3.

### This class will use Python 3

### IDE Selection

Also, I recommend you use [the Mu Python editor](https://codewith.mu/) to run your
Python programs. It's easy to use, and comes complete with all the libraries
you'll need for this course. However, you may use other editors like the built-in Python IDLE or Microsoft VS Code.
